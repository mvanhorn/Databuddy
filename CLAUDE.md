# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

Databuddy is a comprehensive analytics platform — a Turborepo monorepo using Bun as the package manager and runtime. It consists of multiple apps (dashboard, API, data collectors) and shared packages, backed by PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, and Redis.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start dashboard + API only (most common)
bun run dev:dashboard

# Start all apps
bun run dev

# Lint
bun run lint

# Format
bun run format

# Type check
bun run check-types

# Run tests
bun run test
bun run test:watch

# Database
bun run db:push          # Apply schema changes (no migration files)
bun run db:migrate       # Run migration files
bun run db:studio        # Open Drizzle Studio GUI
bun run workspace [--reset] [--anomaly] [--events N] [--website <ID>]  # Local login, website and seeded analytics

# SDK (must build before dev if SDK changed)
bun run sdk:build

# Build everything
bun run build
```

**Note:** All commands use `dotenv --` prefix internally to load `.env` — just run them from root.

### Running a single test

```bash
# From root
cd apps/api && bun test path/to/test.ts

# Or with filter
cd apps/api && bun test --test-name-pattern "test name"
```

## Initial Setup

```bash
bun install
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose up -d          # PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Redis
bun run db:push
bun run clickhouse:init       # from packages/db
bun run sdk:build
bun run dev:dashboard
```

```

### Data Flow

```
Browser (SDK/tracker) → basket (ingestion) → ClickHouse (analytics warehouse)
                                           → PostgreSQL (relational data)

Dashboard (Next.js) ←→ ORPC (rpc package) ←→ API (Elysia) → PostgreSQL + ClickHouse + Redis
```

### Key Patterns

**RPC Layer (`packages/rpc`)**: The central type-safe API contract between dashboard and api. Dashboard uses ORPC client with TanStack Query; API implements the procedures. Adding a new endpoint means defining it in `rpc`, implementing it in `api`, and calling it from `dashboard`.

**Database Layer (`packages/db`)**: Single source of truth for all schemas. Uses Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL (relational data: users, websites, settings) and a ClickHouse client for analytics data (events, sessions, pageviews). Schema changes use `db:push` for development; `db:migrate` for production migrations.

**Caching (`packages/redis`)**: `cacheable()` wraps repeated lookups with positive + negative caching, single-flight dedup, stale-while-revalidate, and Redis fallback. Pass `reviveDates: false` when the cached value carries ISO-string timestamps validated by `z.string()` output schemas.

**Auth (`packages/auth`)**: Better-Auth handles sessions. The package also contains the permission system used across all apps.

**State management in Dashboard**: Jotai for local UI state, TanStack Query for server state.

### Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Bun 1.3.14+
- **Frontend**: Next.js 16, React 19, TailwindCSS 4, Radix UI, Recharts
- **Backend**: Elysia.js (Bun-native HTTP framework)
- **API layer**: ORPC (type-safe RPC with OpenAPI generation)
- **Auth**: Better-Auth
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL 17, ClickHouse 25.5, Redis 7
- **Validation**: Zod 4
- **Linting/Formatting**: Biome via Ultracite
- **Build**: Turborepo + Bun

## Code Style

- **Linter/Formatter**: Ultracite (Biome-based). Run `bun run lint` / `bun run format`.
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode. Always use proper types — avoid `any`.
- **Commit format**: `<type>(<scope>): <description>` (e.g., `feat(dashboard): add export button`, `fix(api): handle null session`)
- **Commit slicing rule**: Prefer one commit per coherent product or technical slice, not one giant snapshot and not ultra-fragmented file-by-file commits.
  - Split commits by intent: feature, bug fix, refactor, style/copy pass, or migration slice.
  - Use the dominant surface as scope: `dashboard`, `api`, `rpc`, `basket`, `docs`, `db`, `sdk`, `tracker`, `deps`, `ci`.
  - Group closely related UI files into one commit when they ship one visible change.
  - Keep unrelated surfaces in separate commits even if they were edited in the same session.
  - For broad migrations, follow the repo’s existing pattern: one commit per meaningful area, e.g. `feat(dashboard): migrate home, events, insights, and links pages to DS primitives`.
  - Before committing, check `git diff --stat` and `git status --short`; if the diff mixes unrelated intents, split it.
  - Only make a single snapshot commit for the whole worktree when the user explicitly asks to include everything as-is.
- **PRs**: Open against `staging` branch (not `main`).

## Tests

Runners: `apps/api` and `apps/basket` use vitest; every other package uses `bun test`. Import helpers from the runner the package actually runs (`bun:test` vs `vitest`); `bun run lint:policies` rejects the wrong one. Biome and most `tsconfig.json` files exclude test files, so format tests by hand (tabs, no blank line before a closing `});`) and keep imports honest.

**Every test file must be reachable.** A package that contains `*.test.ts(x)` needs a `test` script, and any file path named in a `test*` script must exist; `lint:policies` enforces both, and only counts a file as run when CI reaches it through the package's `test` or `test:integration` script. Env-gated integration files go in the package's `test:integration` script, which sets its own gate flags; CI runs every package's `test:integration` with one `turbo run test:integration` step, so never wire a suite as its own `ci.yml` step. A gated file nobody runs is dead, not "for later".

**Integration tests use the shared services only.** Postgres `databuddy_test` on 5432, Redis on 6379, ClickHouse on 8123, via `import "@databuddy/test/env"` as the first import. Never pin a test to a scratch container port; `lint:policies` rejects five-digit loopback ports in test files. A test that needs isolation uses its own organization, website, or table names and cleans them up.

**Do not write these tests.** They were removed in bulk once and will be removed again:
- Constant snapshots: asserting a constant or config equals a literal copy of itself. Drift guards that compare two sources of truth are the exception.
- Mock echo: mocking a dependency and asserting it was called with the arguments the test passed in.
- Library behaviour: zod defaults, drizzle column config, ai-sdk retries, bun or node semantics.
- Duplicates: add a case to the existing `<module>.test.ts` instead of creating `<module>-extra.test.ts`, `<module>-boundary.test.ts`, or a "fuzz" file that reruns fixed inputs.
- `.skip` or `.todo` without an issue link, or a `describe.skip` that never turns on.

```bash
# Run every integration suite (requires Docker: postgres, redis, clickhouse)
bun run test:integration

# One package
cd apps/api && bun run test:integration

# One-time setup for test DB
cd packages/db && DATABASE_URL="postgres://databuddy:databuddy_dev_password@localhost:5432/databuddy_test" bunx drizzle-kit push
```

**Key helpers from `@databuddy/test`:**
- `signUp()` — creates a real user via better-auth with session cookie
- `addToOrganization(userId, orgId, role)` — inserts member row
- `userContext(user, orgId)` / `apiKeyContext(orgId, scopes)` — builds RPC Context
- `insertOrganization()` / `insertWebsite()` / `insertApiKey()` — DB factories
- `expectCode(promise, "FORBIDDEN")` — asserts ORPCError code
- `reset()` / `cleanup()` — truncate tables / close connections
- `import "@databuddy/test/env"` — sets test env vars (must be first import)

**Rules for integration tests:**
- Always `import "@databuddy/test/env"` as the first line
- Use `const iit = hasTestDb ? it : it.skip` for graceful skip when Docker is down
- Use `userContext` / `apiKeyContext` / `expectCode` from the test package — don't redefine locally
- Type API key objects against `Context["apiKey"]` to catch schema drift
- `beforeEach(() => reset())` and `afterAll(() => cleanup())` in every file
- Business context lives in `organization_business_contexts`, never `organization.metadata`; fixtures that write metadata test nothing

## Drift Prevention

- **Time series bucket in the site's timezone.** Query builders bucket with `toDate(toTimeZone(time, {timezone:String}))` (or `toStartOfHour`), passing `ctx.timezone || "UTC"`; a bare `toDate(time)` buckets by UTC day and shifts evening traffic to the next day. Date-only ranges are bound in the same timezone: `SimpleQueryBuilder` turns `toDateTime({startDate:String})` and `toDateTime(concat({endDate:String}, ' 23:59:59'))` into timezone-aware bounds for non-UTC requests, so write those forms and never convert dates by hand; totals and daily buckets then cover the same local days.
- **AI agent analytics has one source per list.** The agent registry (ids, names, products, purposes) is `packages/shared/src/utils/bot-detection/ai-agents.ts`, generated from the vendored `well-known-bots.json`; the lists the dashboard needs (`FEATURED_AI_PRODUCTS`, `CONTENT_FORMATS`, `AgentPurpose`, `ROBOTS_ACCESS`) live in the lightweight `bot-detection/types.ts`, because importing `ai-agents.ts` into the dashboard pulls the 437 KB bot JSON into the bundle. Name crawlers and products from the registry by `agent_id`, never from the stored `bot_name` (rows written before the October 2026 detector fix can hold browser engines like "WebKit" or "unknown"). The logo list (`AI_ICON_COLORS`, resolved with `aiProductIcon`) also lives in `bot-detection/types.ts` and must match `apps/dashboard/public/ai/*.svg` and the email logos in `apps/dashboard/public/ai/email/*.png`; `icon.test.ts` enforces both and that every featured product has a logo.
- **Type test objects against their source type.** Fake API keys must be typed as `Context["apiKey"]`, fake users as `User`, etc. Tests are not type-checked, so this does not fail the build; it makes a partial fixture visible in review and in the editor instead of silently passing.
- **Never hand-write dependency versions.** Use `bun add <pkg>` to add dependencies. Hand-written version ranges drift from lockfile reality and cause phantom resolution bugs.
- **Shared test helpers over local copies.** `expectCode`, `userContext`, `apiKeyContext`, env setup — these live in `@databuddy/test`. If you're about to define a helper that already exists there, import it instead.
- **Scope maps must match.** If `RESOURCE_SCOPE_OVERRIDES` changes in `packages/api-keys/src/scopes.ts`, the integration tests in `link-handlers.test.ts` and `with-workspace.test.ts` must be updated to match. The link resource is mapped there (`read:links` for read, `write:links` for create/update/delete), as is the flag resource (`manage:flags` for create/update/delete). Both are enforced solely by `withWorkspace`; there are no separate pre-check layers. New resources also need role grants in `packages/auth/src/permissions.ts` (statement plus each role).
- **Identity columns are governed by `packages/db/src/clickhouse/identity.ts`.** `PROFILE_ID_TABLES` lists every ClickHouse table carrying `profile_id`; `identity.test.ts` enforces that each entry has a CREATE column, an idempotent migration, and `profile_id` + `anonymous_id` in the agent SQL allowlist. Adding `profile_id` to a table means adding it there and following the failing test. Query-side identity stitching must use `EVENTS_VISITOR_KEY` / `CUSTOM_EVENTS_VISITOR_KEY` / `visitorMatch()` from that module — never inline the expression. Analytics columns labelled visitors use `uniq(anonymous_id)` so every page reports the same number as the overview; `uniq(session_id)` counts sessions and must be labelled that way. Profile write semantics (trait splitting, upserts) live in `@databuddy/services/identity`; `profile_id` values are customer-supplied and are never salted, unlike `anonymous_id`.
